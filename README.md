## Getting Started

[Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) is required for development.

On cloning this repository, you will need to install the required dependencies.

To install dependencies, run this in the root directory of your local repository:

Note that `ctrl`+`shift`+`I` will open the inspector while the application is running (helpful while debugging).
